# ZooKeeper
This is a script for a virtual zoo, where cameras are set up in different habitats to monitor animals. There are six animals featured: camel, lion, deer, goose, bat, and rabbit. The script uses string formatting to print out the different animal habitats, which includes a message indicating that the camera is being switched on, a ASCII art representation of the animal, and a message about what the animal is doing. For example, the camel habitat includes the message "Switching on the camera in the camel habitat...", followed by an ASCII art representation of a camel, and a message that the camel is sunbathing. Similarly, the lion habitat includes the message "Switching on the camera in the lion habitat...", an ASCII art representation of a lion, and a message that the lion is roaring.
